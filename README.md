### THIS IS README ME

## 1. Who is your client?

back2bikes is a social enterprise, providing bicycle training, repair and recycling services for the local community, asylum seekers and refugees.

back2bikes is run by volunteers, and is supported by Port Phillip Council.

They are looking for:

*  New volunteer mechanics (no skills required)
*  New volunteers to promote them
*  Donations of usable bikes and parts
*  Bike servicing

They offer:

* Quality secondhand bikes for sales
* Cheap servicing and parts
* (Paid) Maintenance courses
* Free training for volunteers
* Bikes for refugees and asylum seekers

We are happy to be involved with an organisation that helps the community and is not for profit.

## 2. What is your clientâ€™s need (i.e. challenge) that you will be addressing in yourproject?

Back2bikes buy all of their parts from one supplier, Bicycle Parts Wholesale and they do not provide RRP (Recommended Retail Price) to them.
At present they can't hide the trade price from the customer when looking at their web site. 

http://www.bicyclepartswholesale.com.au/page/10/product-catalogues

Bicycle Parts Wholesale (BPW) publish a glossy colour catalogue, which is essential when placing orders, as the photos on the web site and the descriptions are not always adequate to work out which part to order.

Back2bikes have a XLSX file of their database. It is simply a list of a part number, a short description and a bar code number. No category or sub-category information is available.

So we need to do the following:

* Import the parts list and prices to our (Mongo) database
* Provide a simple page (within their existing Meteor app) to allow searching of the database, either by name or part no
* Write an algorithm to calculate a RRP
* Display the price of the part(s) found as a list
* Provide an advanced search option

### Possible extension: 

* Allow part to be added to a draft order, with a quantity
* Review draft order, add/remove parts
* Send order to supplier (via email)
* BPW will send them updates to the price list regurarly. An update process should allow an import of the new XLSX file, but it should be checked to make sure that 1) The number of items should be +/- 10%, average prices should also be +/- 10%

All to be done using React, Storybook, TDD

### Pricing algorithm

* The first calculation is to double the wholesale price to make RRP. 
* This helps to cover GST and shipping costs.
* Anything over $60, the margin is 50%
* Anything over $100 the margin is 30%

## 7. Identify and describe the infrastructure (i.e. hardware) that your App will run on.

Even though our app will be deployed online, it will primarily be accessed from just one computer in the back2bikes workspace. The App will not be hosted on a local server but deployed to the cloud. 

The app will exist online, hosted by the back2bikes current site. They already run an attendance web app that the volunteers use to sign in and out when they are in attendance. Our app will integrate into this seamlessly.

## 18. Provide an overview and description of your Source control process

### Git branching strategy:

- master

The master branch corresponds to the code that is currently in production. Every time we do a deployment to production, we put a tag in git, so that we have a way to go back to a particular release (in case we ever need to). This branch is protected to prevent accidental updates

- develop

The develop branch corresponds to the code that is currently on the staging server. Similarly these versions are tagged in git when we deploy them, and the branch is also protected.

- feature/xxx branches

Feature branches are for developing particular features, for example a feature to add a part to an order might be named feature/order-add-part. 

All branches should be created from develop.  You should never create a branch from another , unless there is a dependency on code in that branch.

- fix/xxx branches

If you are making changes to address a bug that is not urgent, you should use a branch name like fix/xxx. This change will go through the regular release workflow just like feature changes.

- hotfix/xxx branches

If you are making changes to address a bug that is urgent, and needs to be installed without delay, then you can use the hotfix prefix. The branch should be created from the master branch, as it will be merge directly into master, and deployed from there. This workflow is unusual, and does not follow the regular release procedure. It should be limited to small changes, to minimise the risk of failure.
