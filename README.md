### 5. Identify and describe the software (including databases) to be used in your App.

* **React**
  * React is a front-end framework to help build websites through segregated components. We can then combine these components to create a UI that is fast, reactive and functional. We will be using react to create Back2Bikes Parts ordering system alongside Meteor.
* **Meteor**
  * Meteor is a full-stack JavaScript platform, which allows development in one language (JavaScript) across all environments. There are a few key components that make meteor unique, such as:
    * Meteor doesn't send HTML over the network. The server sends data and lets the client render it.
    * The database methods are available everywhere. You can   use these within the client and the server.
    * Meteor prefetches data and simulates models to make it seem like server method calls are returned instantly.<br/>
* **Visual Studio Code**
  * Visual Studio Code is a source code editor. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring. This is our standard text editor, but some may opt to not use it.
* **Storybook**
  * Storybook is a development environment for UI components. It allows you to browse a component library, view the different states of each component, and interactively develop and test components. We will be using this throughout our testing phases before pushed to production.
* **Figma**
  * Our standard for designing and will be used to create our wireframes. Figma is a free software that makes wireframing very easy with the ability to create components and reuse them in our design however we like.
* **Nuclino**
  * Nuclino is a cloud-based team collaboration software which allows teams to collaborate and share information in real-time. We will be using this to share information that will stay the same throughout the length of the project, such as coding standards and git workflow practices.
* **Trello**
  * Trello is a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards. In one glance, Trello tells you what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process. We will be using this throughout the project to track who is working on what and what is being worked on, so there is no overlap.

* **MongoDB** is the database used in our application. Our client already uses this so we will continue to do the same for consistency.

### 11. Identify the database to be used in your app and provide a justification for your choice.

**MongoDB** is the database used in our application. Our client already uses this so we will continue to do the same for consistency.

Using a MongoDB data model lets us represent hierachical relationships, data arrays and other complex structures we may need to take advantage of during development.

### 17. Discuss how Agile methodology is being implemented in your App.

We will work as an agile team. This means:
* Sprints (1 week)
* Aim for Minimal Viable Product (MVP)
* From the Agile Manifesto:
  * Working code over documentation 
  * Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools
  * Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation
  * Responding to Change Over Following a Plan

Other agile gems:
* Frequent delivery of working softwareÂ 
* Fail quickly (or don't be afraid to fail and change course)

How do we do this? 
* Use Trello as our Kanban board for the sprint
* Work on one thing at a time
* Talk about what it is, and how to do it
* Challenge the story

### 22. Research what your legal obligations are in relation to handling user data.

The GDPR is the most official guidelines regarding handling of personal information.
The GDPR states: if we are to store personal data we are to disclose the fact that we are doing so, or not do so at all. No personal data may be processed unless it is done under a lawful basis. Users of the application may request a copy of the personal information collected in a common format, and may have the right to delete any data upon request.

Because we are only creating an application based on making orders and will only be used by staff of the company, we will not have to worry about the GDPR guidelines.
